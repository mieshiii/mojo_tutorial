- Mojo is a compiled language. Much of it speed is derived from that.
- Every program must include a fn main() as the entry point
- Seems like typing is strict on Mojo as compared to Python
- importing Python libs/func as easy as:
  from python import Python

  let np = Python.import_module("numpy")

  ar = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
  print(ar)
  print(ar.shape)
